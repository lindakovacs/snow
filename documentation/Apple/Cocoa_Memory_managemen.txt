Objective-C provides two methods of application memory management.
1
In the method described in this guide, referred to as “manual retain-release” or MRR, you explicitly manage memory by keeping track of objects you own.
This is implemented using a model, known as reference counting, that the Foundation class NSObject provides in conjunction with the runtime environment.
2
In Automatic Reference Counting, or ARC, the system uses the same reference counting system as MRR, but it inserts the appropriate memory management method calls for you at compile-time.
You are strongly encouraged to use ARC for new projects

Для отладки и поиска проблем с памятью можно использовать Clang Static Analyzer, встроенный в Xcode, или объект NSZombie.
